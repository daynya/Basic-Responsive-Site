                <p>
                    You'll notice that I don't have any extra stuff here. I'm pretty
                    passionate about functional design. I like to let the content be 
                    the message. In this case, I am building this site as a quick skills 
                    assessment for Randall-Reilly. There isn't much content that needs
                    to be displayed, so I may as well go ahead and make it personal.

                    <h2>This is Seymour</h2>
                    <p>
                        Seymour is a Maine Coon. If you don't like cats, well, all you
                        need to know is that they are large, and generally pretty amazing,
                        feline specimens. Seymour is coming up on 9 years old, and I have
                        had him in my life since he was an 8 week old kitten. To be honest,
                        most of the time he still acts like an 8 week old kitten. Never have
                        I ever met a more needy cat. He's precious and attached at my hip,
                        and I wouldn't have it any other way. His interests include eating,
                        sleeping, disrupting my sleeping, and the occasional nap in the sun.
                        We need to have his fur shaved off every 6-9 months, and this is
                        the result. A majestic lion. Seymour weighs about 19 pounds, which 
                        seems pretty large for a cat, but honestly when he's shaved, he
                        doesn't look nearly that large.

                    <h2>This is Bean</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bean is your typical tabby female. She's sassy, she's lazy, and she
                        may be the sweetest cat I've ever met. She is happy to demand your
                        attention, but she is also the only one of our cats that never fights
                        back. Unfortunately, she gets picked on a lot as a result. Her gentle
                        nature makes her a favorite of any human who has ever had the honor
                        of meeting her. Interestingly, she is a Hemingway cat - meaning that
                        she has extra digits on her paws. I like to refer to them as her thumbs,
                        though she has yet to do anything useful with them (that I've seen, anyway).
                        She is a huge fan of napping and lounging on pillows, and cannot resist
                        a good old fashioned game of chase the string. She's pretty chill, and
                        a genuine delight to spend time with.

                                    Robert is one of a kind. The kind of lady who deserves her very own
                                    pop-up modal on a webpage, ya know? That's right. Robert is a girl. 
                                    We don't follow traditional rules in our household. Also we may or 
                                    may not have thought Robert was a boy until the vet educated us on
                                    the fact that most Calico cats are female. Who knew? Robert's mom 
                                    was a feral cat in our neighborhood. We tried to capture and spay her,
                                    but her street ways got the best of us, and no such luck. We fed her
                                    and cared about her, but she was terrified of humans. Not surprisingly,
                                    one day she showed up pregnant. We wondered what would happen to a 
                                    kitten on the streets of South End (which was nothing like the South
                                    End of 2019, mind you). We soon found out. She basically dropped the 
                                    kitten off at our doorstep and never looked back. We fed her and 
                                    acclimated her to human touch for a couple of months before we decided
                                    we needed to bring her in, and make her part of our crew. Our lives have
                                    never been the same. Full of street smarts, she's the hunter of the house.
                                    She's highly sensitive, and quick to get her feelings hurt. Once you win
                                    her over, you have a close pal for life. I'm grateful she lets me 
                                    share a home with her. She's a fascinating specimen, and I'm honored
                                    that she chose us to be her family.
