                <p>
                    You'll notice that I don't have any extra stuff here. I'm pretty
                    passionate about functional design. I like to let the content be 
                    the message. In this case, I am building this site as a quick skills 
                    assessment for Randall-Reilly. There isn't much content that needs
                    to be displayed, so I may as well go ahead and make it personal.

                    <h2>This is Seymour</h2>
                    <p>
                        Seymour is a Maine Coon. If you don't like cats, well, all you
                        need to know is that they are large, and generally pretty amazing,
                        feline specimens. Seymour is coming up on 9 years old, and I have
                        had him in my life since he was an 8 week old kitten. To be honest,
                        most of the time he still acts like an 8 week old kitten. Never have
                        I ever met a more needy cat. He's precious and attached at my hip,
                        and I wouldn't have it any other way. His interests include eating,
                        sleeping, disrupting my sleeping, and the occasional nap in the sun.
                        We need to have his fur shaved off every 6-9 months, and this is
                        the result. A majestic lion. Seymour weighs about 19 pounds, which 
                        seems pretty large for a cat, but honestly when he's shaved, he
                        doesn't look nearly that large.

                    <h2>This is Bean</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bean is your typical tabby female. She's sassy, she's lazy, and she
                        may be the sweetest cat I've ever met. She is happy to demand your
                        attention, but she is also the only one of our cats that never fights
                        back. Unfortunately, she gets picked on a lot as a result. Her gentle
                        nature makes her a favorite of any human who has ever had the honor
                        of meeting her. Interestingly, she is a Hemingway cat - meaning that
                        she has extra digits on her paws. I like to refer to them as her thumbs,
                        though she has yet to do anything useful with them (that I've seen, anyway).
                        She is a huge fan of napping and lounging on pillows, and cannot resist
                        a good old fashioned game of chase the string. She's pretty chill, and
                        a genuine delight to spend time with.
